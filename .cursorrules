# 🔒 WEBSITE COPY INTEGRITY — NON-EDITABLE CONTENT POLICY

## Global Rule
Any text provided by the user in a prompt that could be used in a website, app interface, or marketing asset (hero, heading, subtitle, paragraph, FAQ, button, meta, article, post, or any textual element)
MUST be treated as FINAL COPY.

## Prohibited actions
❌ Do not rewrite, paraphrase, summarize, expand, shorten, "improve", fix grammar, or adjust tone.
❌ Do not alter punctuation, dashes, spaces, capitalization, spelling, or quotes.
❌ Do not normalize typography (e.g. replace "–" or "—" with "-", or vice versa).
❌ Do not reflow or escape text strings when embedding them in code (preserve as-is).
❌ Do not translate.
❌ Do not auto-replace curly quotes, typographic dashes, or symbols.

## Conditional behavior
- If the user's message contains any block of text (multi-line, headline, paragraph, or bullet) intended for website or product copy, treat it as immutable content.
- The only allowed modifications are:
  ✅ wrapping the text in component props or template literals;
  ✅ assigning it to variables/constants;
  ✅ styling, layout, or responsive changes.

## Permission handling
If you believe a copy block needs changes (typo, consistency, readability, tone, or translation), you MUST:
1. Ask explicit permission from the user: "May I edit or rephrase this text?"
2. Proceed ONLY if the user answers yes.

## Example enforcement
Bad (disallowed):
> Rewriting "Pay contractors in USD wallets" to "Easily pay your contractors via USD wallets."

Good (allowed):
> Keeping "Pay contractors in USD wallets" as-is, but changing its visual layout, typography, color, or component structure.

## Hierarchy
This rule overrides all other rewrite, grammar, or localization rules in this workspace.
It applies automatically to any text given by the user — no special markers like <<<COPY>>> are required.

Implementation checklist for the agent:
1. Detect any user-provided text content (multi-line strings, UI labels, hero sections, etc.).
2. Assume it is website copy and lock it as immutable.
3. Ask before changing or regenerating textual content.
4. When saving or inserting into components, confirm that the string is byte-for-byte identical to what the user provided.

## Code Implementation Guidelines

### Copy Storage
- Store all copy in dedicated constants files (e.g., `copy/compare/deel.ts`)
- Use template strings (`...`) to preserve exact formatting
- Avoid `.trim()`, `.replace()`, or any string manipulation methods
- Pass copy as props to components

### Example Structure
```typescript
// copy/compare/deel.ts
export const deelCopy = {
  hero: {
    title: `Pay contractors in USD wallets`,
    subtitle: `No more currency conversion headaches`
  }
} as const;
```

### Component Usage
```typescript
import { deelCopy } from '@/copy/compare/deel';

export function HeroSection() {
  return (
    <h1>{deelCopy.hero.title}</h1>
    <p>{deelCopy.hero.subtitle}</p>
  );
}
```
